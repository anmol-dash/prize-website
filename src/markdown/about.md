# About Us

## We're the generation to solve climate change.
It's no secret that Gen Z and Gen Alpha have to take the reins on the environment. We have the most at stake.
 
We need real innovations and real effort from engineers and business leaders to build the solutions that activists and policymakers can champion. Talent is the bottleneck, and we need you.

## Let's push Penn into Climate.
Imagine a campus where students line up out the doors to work for the biggest movers in climate innovation.
​
Imagine a campus where sustainability and climate analyses are integrated into our course plans, just like basic statistics or calculus.
 
Imagine a campus where climate was just... common sense. 
 
That's what we're building. Come along for the ride.
